# SageBook

The goal of the project is to build a book catalog and recommendation system where users can look up books and receive book recommendations based on their preferences. Users can save any book to their favorite list which serves as a personal bookshelf. The idea is motivated by the team’s common interest in reading. We are constantly seeking new interesting books to read. The book platforms currently on the market do not provide all the features we are looking for. Specifically, they only recommend books that fit users’ past reading patterns and not books in an unfamiliar genre. We want to make users’ reading experiences convenient, informed, but also interesting and fun!
